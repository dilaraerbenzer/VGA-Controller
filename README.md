# VGA-Controller

A VGA controller module in SystemVerilog for the Basys 3 FPGA board, enabling high-quality graphics output to standard monitors. Implemented precise timing, synchronization, and pixel control for full-colour, high-resolution displays. Utilising digital design principles, finite and high-level state machines, memory interfacing, and read/write logic. Additionally, incorporated mouse/keyboard control with drawing capabilities, similar to MS Paint, offering color selection and drawing features.
